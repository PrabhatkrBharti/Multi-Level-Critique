NIPS,491,"3) I think the comparison in the simulation part is not fair because of the following reasons,   i)  There is no run-time data for the numerical experiments.  Sample complexity is not the only factor that shows the complexity of the algorithm.  In many problems, including compressive linear regression, it is possible to solve the problem with information theoretic bounds for sample complexity at the cost of exponential run-time.  If the claim is having efficient sample complexity, some computational complexity should be included as well.  Moreover, in comparison of different methods, this should be considered.",5,1

ShitMyReviews,,Use of words like 'performativity' (is that a word?),2,1
ICLR,SySpa-Z0Z_R2,"Terms like this will emerge in many other models , where one assumes diagonal covariance Gaussians ; in fact the easiest model to justify this penalty is just to say one introduces diagonal Gaussian prior over activations , and thats it .",5,1
ShitMyReviews,,That gives a ridiculous demonstration where authors forgot science and reinvent history (...) the authors don't have a clue of what was already done in the literature.,1,3

ShitMyReviews,,Your proposed method should be compared with another method that introduced in a prestigious paper'[full review],4,2
ICLR,B1e5ef-C-_R3,My most criticism regarding this paper is the narrow scope,2,2
NIPS,286,All theories in section 2 could be generalized to the unit sphere?  [Fixing alpha] It seems to be too restrictive to fix alpha=1.

To this end, it would be more informative to compare with an auto-regressive prior where each conditional could be relaxed into a concrete distribution (e.g. parameterized by an RNN or (dilated) CNN with comparable parameter size). Since the auto-regressive prior can yield the exact probability, training can be directly performed with the IWAE objective. In terms of the sampling, an auto-regressive prior and an RBM prior could be similarly slow.  Overall, I think this is an interesting paper with positive empirical results. However, whether the RBM prior is a necessary or the best choice is not clear yet.  ",5,1
